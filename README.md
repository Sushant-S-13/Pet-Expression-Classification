# Pet Expression Classification
 
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying pet facial expressions into different emotional states using the Pet's Facial Expression Image Dataset. The model utilizes deep learning techniques to preprocess, analyze, and accurately classify images of pets into categories such as "happy," "sad," "angry," and "other."

## Goals
- Build a robust machine learning classification model to identify pet facial expressions.
- Demonstrate the ability to preprocess and analyze complex image datasets effectively.
- Provide comprehensive insights through model evaluation metrics and visualizations.
