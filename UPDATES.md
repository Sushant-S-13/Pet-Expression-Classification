### Update 01
- Created a new GitHub repository for the pet expression classification project.
- Installed necessary libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas.
- Downloaded the Pet's Facial Expression Image Dataset from Kaggle and explored its structure.
- Committed the initial project structure, including a README file outlining project goals and objectives.
### Update 02
Obsevation from the first training phase :
- The training accuracy increases steadily and approaches 100%, indicating the model fits the training data well.
- The validation accuracy fluctuates and remains significantly lower, showing poor generalization to unseen data.
### Update 03
Attempt to resolve the overfitting issue by using
- Data Augmentation
- Smaller Model Architecture
- Dropout Layers
- Early Stopping
